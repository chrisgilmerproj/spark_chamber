The primary coil has 7 turns in a layer with 0.8mm wire.
250 secondary windings, each layer with a snug layer kapton
(or other HV tape). This wire is 0.3mm diameter.
The windings must be neatly next to each other.
If at a location between the insulation is not sufficient then there is a
instead of spark at the spark plug. Furthermore, the core from a piece of ferrite
an AM radio or something!
Â  Greetings, Cees.
